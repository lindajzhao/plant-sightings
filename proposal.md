## Project Name

Plant Sightings

## Project Description

An app to record observations of plants, and get more information about them.

## MVC Goals

1. User should be able access plant details by searching by plant name (https://trefle.io/ API)
2. Users should be able to create and delete logs containing: plant name (or trefle ID), location, note, date & time (+ photos as stretch goal).
3. Users should be able to delete previous records.

## Stretch Goals

1. Allow users to upload photo(s)
2. Add filters by date range, location, plant name
3. Add Google location API, so that users can type in their location and I can save the lat/long
4. Use PlantNet API instead of trefle, which identifies plants using photos
